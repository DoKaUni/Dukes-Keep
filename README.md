# Duke's Keep
Duke's Keep is a open-source, completely machine local password manager that securely manages your password entries. It was made from the ground up so that the user, if needed, could use their passwords on a "need-to-know" basis. Duke's Keep has various functions that can be used to reduce the chances of passwords being compromised, even if malware, such as Spyware or Keyloggers are active on the system.

### Supported platforms
* 64bit Windows 10/11.

## <font color="red">This is currently a prototype/POC</font>
In it's current build, Duke's Keep is made to showcase the functionalities of anti-malware (Spyware, Keylogger) counter-measures. It is currently still lacking a secure store for it's main encryption key while the program is running. Additionally there are no recovery options, if you've forgotten your master password. **In it's current form, it is not recommended to use this as your main password manager** *yet*.

## Releases
You can view the current releases on the [releases page](https://github.com/DoKaUni/Dukes-Keep/releases). After you've downloaded one of the releases, make sure to also check if the MD5/SHA256 hash matches the ones given.
